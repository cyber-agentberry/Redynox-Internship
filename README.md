# 🛡️ Redynox Cybersecurity Internship Report

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the final documentation and deliverables from my cybersecurity internship at **Redynox**. This repository outlines the practical tasks I completed, tools I used, and the hands-on experience I gained while working on network and web application security.

---

## 📌 Overview

The internship was divided into two main tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Network Security Implementation
- Built a virtual lab using **VMware Fusion**
- Configured **pfSense firewall** for routing and traffic control
- Simulated a reverse shell attack using **Metasploit (msfvenom)**
- Analyzed traffic with **Wireshark**
- Enforced security using **Windows Defender Firewall**

### ✅ Task 2: Web Application Security
- Explored and exploited:
  - **SQL Injection (SQLi)**
  - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
- Used **WebGoat** as the target platform
- Conducted scans with **OWASP ZAP**
- Verified attacks with **WebWolf** and browser dev tools
